# Lung Cancer Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting lung cancer risk using a dataset that has been rigorously preprocessed, encompassing over 1,000 records. Through the implementation of multinomial logistic regression and the application of AutoML techniques, the project evaluates more than 50 distinct models. Special attention was given to Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and XGBoost models due to their robust performance in predictive analytics.

Key Features
Multinomial Logistic Regression: Initiated the analysis with a foundational statistical approach to categorize the data based on various predictors of lung cancer.
AutoML Evaluation: Leveraged AutoML to systematically and efficiently assess over 50 distinct predictive models, focusing on performance and scalability.
Advanced Model Analysis: Emphasized Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and XGBoost for their proven efficacy, guided by a comprehensive suite of metrics including accuracy, AUC, RMSE, and MSE.
Performance Metrics:
Achieved an accuracy rate surpassing 95%, indicating a high level of precision in lung cancer risk prediction.
Attained an Area Under the Curve (AUC) greater than 0.99, showcasing the model's excellent capability in distinguishing between patients with and without lung cancer.
Minimized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to less than 0.05, reflecting the model's accuracy in prediction.
Key Predictors Identification: Through meticulous analysis, key predictors of lung cancer risk were identified. Notably, passive smoking and air pollution exposure were highlighted as significant risk factors. For instance, air pollution exposure was associated with a 1.5x increase in lung cancer risk among non-smokers.
